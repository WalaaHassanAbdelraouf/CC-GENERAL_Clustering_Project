# Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive approach to handling outliers, scaling data, reducing dimensionality using PCA, and applying clustering algorithms on a dataset. The aim is to optimize data preprocessing by selecting the best outlier handling method for each column, applying appropriate scaling and dimensionality reduction techniques, and optimizing the number of clusters using the silhouette score.

## Code Structure

1. **Handling Outliers**: The code evaluates and applies the best outlier handling method for each specified column based on the skewness of the data.
2. **Scaling Data**: Different scaling methods (`StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `RobustScaler`) are applied to standardize the data.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, retaining the most significant features.
4. **Clustering Evaluation**: Elbow and silhouette plots are used to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering.
5. **KMeans Clustering**: The best number of clusters is selected and KMeans is applied to the PCA-reduced data.


## Functions

### 1. Handling Outliers
def scale_data(df_handled, scaling_method):
    # Function details...
    
This function scales the data using one of the following methods:
- **StandardScaler**: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- **MinMaxScaler**: Scales features to a given range, typically [0, 1].
- **RobustScaler**: Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers.


### 3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
def apply_pca(scaled_df, n_components):
    # Function details...
    
This function applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the scaled data, reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the variance. The number of components (n_components) can be specified to determine how many principal components to retain.


### 4. Elbow and Silhouette Plotting
def plot_elbow_and_silhouette(scaled_df, scaling_method):
    # Function details...
    
Generates Elbow and Silhouette plots to help visualize and determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for KMeans clustering.


### 5. Finding the Best k
def find_best_k(scaled_df, scaling_method, k_range=range(2, 11)):
    # Function details...
    
This function finds the best number of clusters (k) for KMeans clustering based on the silhouette score. It iterates through a range of k values and selects the one with the highest silhouette score.


### 6. Applying KMeans
def apply_kmeans(scaled_df, n_clusters, scaling_method):
    # Function details...
    
Applies the KMeans clustering algorithm to the PCA-reduced data using the best number of clusters identified. Outputs the cluster labels for further analysis.


## Results

The code provides a robust approach to preprocessing data by handling outliers and scaling, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA. The use of clustering evaluation techniques like the Elbow method and silhouette scores helps in identifying the optimal clustering structure, thus enhancing the overall data analysis process.
